## Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Indian business startups. The goal is to uncover trends, patterns, and insights that will provide a deeper understanding of the startup ecosystem in India. The analysis explores key factors like funding distribution across industries, geographical influence, and the impact of investment types on the success of startups.

By analyzing these variables, this project aims to provide insights to potential entrepreneurs, investors, and policy-makers who are interested in the Indian startup landscape. The data was preprocessed and visualized using Python and key data analysis libraries.

## Introduction
This project aims to perform an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset of Indian business startups. The primary goal is to identify trends and gain insights into the startup ecosystem in India, focusing on industries, funding, location, and other critical factors that impact startup success.

## Objectives
The objectives of this EDA project are:
1. To identify trends and patterns in the Indian startup ecosystem.
2. To analyze the distribution of funding across industries and cities.
3. To investigate the relationship between the type of funding and startup success.
4. To explore the geographical and industrial diversity of Indian startups.
5. To identify potential factors contributing to high startup funding.

## Outcomes
Upon completing the analysis, the following outcomes were achieved:
- Key trends regarding the location, industry, and funding of Indian startups were identified.
- Visualizations and metrics revealed which factors have a significant impact on startup funding.
- An understanding of how the startup ecosystem varies across different regions and industries.
- Valuable insights for potential investors and entrepreneurs on areas with higher opportunities.

## Dataset
- **Source:** [Link to dataset if publicly available]
- **Description:** The dataset contains information on Indian startups such as:
  - Startup name
  - Industry
  - Funding amount
  - Investors
  - Year of establishment
  - Location (City, State)
  - Type of funding (Angel, Seed, Series A, etc.)

## Installation
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/eda-indian-startups.git

2. Navigate to the project directory
cd eda-indian-startups

3. Install the required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
To run the analysis, simply open the Jupyter notebook and execute the cells in the correct order. All code related to data preprocessing, visualization, and analysis will be found in the notebook.

EDA Process
The Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is divided into the following stages:

Data Cleaning
Handling missing values
Converting data types (e.g., dates, currency)
Removing duplicates
Data normalization and standardization
Exploratory Visualizations
Distribution of funding amounts
Number of startups per industry
Top cities for startups
Year-wise establishment of startups
Statistical Analysis
Relationship between funding amount and industry
Correlation between number of investors and funding amounts
Multivariate analysis to understand the combined impact of location, industry, and funding type on startup success
Results
The analysis uncovered important trends such as:

Cities like Bangalore, Mumbai, and Delhi are hubs for startups.
Tech-related industries dominate the startup scene in India.
Series A funding rounds receive the highest funding amounts.
There is a positive correlation between the number of investors and the amount of funding.
Conclusions
This EDA has provided valuable insights into the Indian startup ecosystem, showing the dominance of tech startups, the importance of location, and the various factors affecting startup success.

Future Work
Perform predictive analysis to forecast funding trends.
Analyze startups from different regions for a comparative study.
Conduct a time-series analysis of startup funding over the years.
